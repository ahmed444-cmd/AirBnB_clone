Project Overview: The AirBnB Clone aims to emulate the functionality of the widely-used online platform Airbnb. It facilitates connections between individuals offering accommodations and those seeking temporary lodging. The project unfolds across several phases, with the initial focus on constructing the front end in a step-by-step manner.

Web Static Phase:
During this phase, the objective is to craft straightforward HTML static pages and implement foundational styling using CSS.
Key Steps:

Design/Sketch/Prototype: Prior to delving into intricate web development, the project commences by conceptualizing or sketching each component. This entails outlining the page structure and defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, and images.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML serves as the backbone, providing structure and semantics to content. It constitutes the initial building block when crafting a webpage.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is utilized to enhance the visual appearance of content, encompassing aspects like fonts, colors, and layout design.
Static Pages: Develop static HTML pages featuring mock content. These pages do not entail any interactivity or data retrieval from external sources.
Folder Structure:

All CSS files should reside in a designated styles folder.
Images ought to be housed within an images folder.
Coding Standards:

Adhere to the PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code (version 2.7.*).
Ensure HTML conforms to W3C standards and validate using the W3C Validator.
